# MIES
Minature Insurance Economic Simulator

##Introduction

The purpose of MIES is to simulate, with the appropriate balance between detail and abstraction, various economic equilibria that result between the interactions between insurance firms, policyholders, and regulators.

The goal is to create an explanatory model that links economic theory with actuarial science.
